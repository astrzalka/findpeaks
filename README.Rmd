The goal of findpeaks is to find maxima in fluorescence profile generated from microscopic time-lapse movie of Streptomyces

## Installation

You can install the released version of EDA from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github('astrzalka/findpeaks')

findpeaks::run_app()
```
For running the app package Peaks in required. It can be installed on linux using:

``` r
devtools::install_version('Peaks', version = '0.2', repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

Fluorescence profile data can be prepared using an ImageJ script: imagej_get_profile.ijm , which will save the profiles for all selected ROIs for each channel separately. It will also save ROIs and duplicated tiff file of analyzed hypha in the same directory.
